      Jessica is a 36-year-old Air Force member with a diverse background and a passion for technology. Growing up as an "Army brat," she moved frequently, gaining exposure to different cultures and experiences. She initially pursued a career in teaching, but after struggling with classroom management, she decided to join the Air Force, where her career took a new direction.
      Starting out as a Korean Airborne Linguist, Jessica spent a year and a half learning the language, followed by additional specialized training. After a few years, she and her husband retrained into the Cyber career field, which sparked her interest in technology and software development. She is currently pursuing a software design program at Bellevue to further her skills in web design and programming languages.
      Outside of her professional life, Jessica enjoys spending time with her two German Shepherds, Dizzy and Zumi, who keep her on her toes with their contrasting personalities. She also enjoys indoor bouldering, which she finds to be both a physical challenge and a mental puzzle, and playing board games with her husband and friends.
      One of the defining moments in Jessica’s life came when she transitioned from teaching to the military. After being let go from her teaching job, she was uncertain about her future. Joining the Air Force provided her with stability and a fresh start, and it ultimately led her to meet her husband. This experience, while challenging, set the foundation for her growth both personally and professionally.
      Throughout her career, Jessica has achieved several milestones she’s proud of. She became the go-to person for automating workflow in her work center using Microsoft’s Power Automate and earned a black belt in Taekwondo in her mid-twenties. While she’s currently focused on her career in Cyber and programming, she’s also working on revising a science fantasy novel—a project she plans to revisit once her training is complete.
      Jessica’s goal is to become a programmer, working on projects that combine her interests in technology, language, and education. She envisions creating software for language learning, creative writing, and educational tools. With her ongoing training and a passion for learning, she’s building a future that blends her skills with her personal passions.
      Balancing work, life, and hobbies isn’t always easy, but Jessica embraces it with a laid-back attitude and a focus on prioritizing what matters. Whether it’s managing her professional responsibilities or enjoying downtime with her dogs and husband, Jessica stays positive and focused on her long-term goals.
