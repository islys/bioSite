    <h2> Things Jess Loves Doing</h2>
    <p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me energized and creative:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recently I have enjoyed indoor bouldering a lot because it is a puzzle and a workout in one. It feels very satisfying to figure out how to leverage my strength and skill to navigate challenging routes.  </li>
      <li>I also enjoy playing board games with my husband and sometimes with other friends.</li>
      <li>I enjoy exercise, but I really appreciate a variety in activities. Going to the gym constantly gets old for me, so I love taking the opportunity to do things like hike in new places when the opportunity presents itself!</li>
    </ul>
